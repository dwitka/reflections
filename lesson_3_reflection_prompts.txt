When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	One reason would be if you're always on the go travelling and need to access
	your work from whereever you are. Another reason would be if you're running
	out of space on your computer. The best reason would probably be if you're
	working on a project within a group and everyone needs access to the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
